# 3D-Pong-ATmega128

The aim of this project was to build a vector-based
Pong-like arcade game on an AT MEGA 128. Playing in 3D, the
player moves his paddle in the plane of the screen while the ball is
hit in and out of it. Compatibility with an I2C Nintendo Nunchuk
controller was considered but the idea had to be abandoned in
the development stage due to technical difficulties and strict time
constraints. User input is acquired through a keypad instead. By
the end of the project a fully functional game was successfully
created offering a single player vs. artificial intelligence ( AI )
mode, score and hit detection systems, and multiple difficulty
levels.

The project was carried out at Imperial College London as part of the 3rd year Physics Undergraduate Laboratory course (2015-2016). 

A description of the project and the full assembly code I have written is available in the pdf file in this repo.
